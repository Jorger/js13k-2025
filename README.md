The game features 40 levels, each introducing new challenges and increasing difficulty. Along the way, you will encounter:

* 🧱 **Walls:** Block the cats’ movement and force you to find alternative paths.
* ⚔️ **Spikes:** Deadly traps, if a cat falls onto them, it will be destroyed. However, if you grab the last coin before falling, you won’t lose.
* 🔑 **Keys** & 🚪 **Doors:** Only Roni can pick up keys to unlock doors, allowing Kira to reach the coins.
* 📦 **Boxes:** Useful to block paths and control movement. But be careful, if you push with too much force, the box will break. Sometimes a spike might be hidden underneath!

The game was built using [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) and [Vite](https://vite.dev/). Its small footprint was carefully optimized to fit within the JS13k 13KB size limit.
